Discover how to create and organize content, add menus and sidebars, change the look of the site with templates, control 
who creates and edits content, and much more. The course also shows you how to evaluate the quality of extensions,

web host
vs 
web server
   web page request from user computer
   sends back: index.html, images, CSS, Flash files, JavaScript, and so forth 
   NOTE: php is just run on the server

CMS- A Content Management System or CMS is very different than static site.

index.php   
this tells the server to ask php (middleware) to get stuff from MySQL and process things before sending anything to the client.
PHP requests data
data sent to PHP
PHP arranges the information according to the PHP code
PHP is stripped out and replaced by html and sent to the client

therefore Joomla needs Apache or IIS, PHP and MySQL on the server (see Joomla.org)

In a world where we increasingly integrate photo galleries, calendars, social media, news feeds, blogs, and other dynamic 
information a CMS becomes more important due to the ease of integrating these features into the Web site. If you're still 
feeling like a CMS is complicated, don't panic. This movie was as geeky as the rest of this title gets. Keep watching and 
you will start feeling more comfortable with Joomla! shortly.

   Restoring the site from a backup using the jump-in files (if really really need it)
   see Chapter 1 01_05  (see zip and sql files)
   run xampp
   1) delete the joomla website from my htdocs
   2) copy the files from the zipped file to the location
   3) import sql into database inside phpMyAdmin. Click on my database and click on Drop icon
      create db joomla 
	  import sql data to get it imported (the extention will be different than in the video)
	  MAC :  error will be on database.  So on Mac need to have to adjust configeration file and change password to 'root' and save it 
	         then refresh and you can see it.
